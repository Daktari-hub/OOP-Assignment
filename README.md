Activity 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️
Creating a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
Adding attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
Using constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
Adding an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

Creating a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
